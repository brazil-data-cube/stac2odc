stac2odc is a tool created to facilitate indexing data in the Open Data Cube (ODC) using the information provided by STAC catalogs.

To allow different users to enjoy the benefits of indexing data in the ODC via STAC, stac2odc was developed to support several STAC versions, with varied ways of implementing and organizing resources. This is possible thanks to engine files, which are definition files of how the mapping between STAC and ODC entities should be done.

The engine files have different keys and ways to describe the mapping that is being done. With these files, it is possible to describe the mapping with predefined functions, which have advanced and straightforward mapping options. Still, it is also possible to use customized scripts, which receive the data and allow complex rules to be described.xing products and datasets in an ODC instance.
